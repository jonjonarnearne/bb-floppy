Amiga floppydisk reading vi BeagleBone PRU.

This program has several different ways to read out the timing data.
Most of these subcomands, are in a buggy state or completly not working.

The functions called pru_read_timing and pru_write_timing, which are
the last functions to be added to this code seems to be the only ones
that are almost working.
